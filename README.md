### Project 2

# NYPD Data Challenge: Onyx Data November 2021.
This is my entry for the Onyx Data November 2021 Challenge.

#Here are my findings:
1) 83.13 % are from male perpetrators and 16.87 % from female.
2) Wednesdays is the day of the week when more arrests occur.
3) 49.45% are from black ethnicity followed by 24.59% hispanic.
4) Ages 25-44 is the range with most cases.
5) The offense with most arrests is ‘Assault 3 & related offenses’ followed by ‘Felony assault’.
6) The borough with more cases is The Bronx followed by Manhattan.

My suggestion to the NY Police Department to take action is to increase police presence to reduce crime in the locations, days of the week and take into account the demographics and type of offenses identified.
